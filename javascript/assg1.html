        Performing Mathematical Calculations: The Math object provides methods for common mathematical calculations such
        as rounding numbers (Math.round()), finding the maximum or minimum of a set of numbers (Math.max() and
        Math.min()), calculating absolute values (Math.abs()), generating random numbers (Math.random()), and performing
        trigonometric operations (Math.sin(), Math.cos(), Math.tan()).
    </p>
    <p> Converting Degrees to Radians and Vice Versa: The Math object provides methods for converting angles between
        degrees and radians. You can use Math.degrees() to convert radians to degrees and Math.radians() to convert
        degrees to radians. This is particularly useful when dealing with trigonometric functions or when working with
        libraries like Canvas where angles are often specified in radians.
