1. Variable is a container to store values.  They are reference to a memory location which is used to store value. They are also called Identifiers.

2. Snake_case and camelCase are two different conventions used for naming variables, functions, and identifiers in programming. They differ primarily in how they format words  within the name.

*Snake_case:

In snake_case, words are separated by underscores ('_').
All letters are typically lowercase.
It is commonly used in languages like Python for naming variables, functions, and file names.
Example: my_variable_name, calculate_average, file_name.txt

*camelCase:

In camelCase, words are concatenated together, and each word after the first begins with a capital letter (except the first word).
It can be categorized into two types: UpperCamelCase (also known as PascalCase), where the first letter is capitalized, and lowerCamelCase, where the first letter is lowercase.
It is commonly used in languages like Java, JavaScript, and C# for naming variables, functions, and class names.
Example (UpperCamelCase): CalculateAverage, MyVariableName, FileNameTxt
Example (lowerCamelCase): calculateAverage, myVariableName, fileNameTxt


3. Integer division, also known as floor division or truncating division, is a mathematical operation that divides one integer by another and yields an integer result.
result = 10 // 3
print(result)  # Output: 3

4. def exchange_without_temp(a, b):
    a = a + b
    b = a - b
    a = a - b
    return a, b

num1 = 10
num2 = 20
print("Before swapping:", num1, num2)
num1, num2 = exchange_without_temp(num1, num2)
print("After swapping:", num1, num2)
output:-
Before swapping: 10 20
After swapping: 20 10


5. user_input = input("Enter a string: ")
print("You entered:", user_input)
output:-
Enter a string: siddhesh
You entered: siddhesh

6. a = int(input("Enter a string: "))
b = int(input("Enter a string: "))
c = int(input("Enter a string: "))

def average(a,b,c):
    return (a + b + c) / 3
print(f"The average of the three strings is {int(average(a,b,c))} ") 
output:-
Enter a string: 50
Enter a string: 40
Enter a string: 80
The average of the three strings is 56
